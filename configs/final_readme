Replace sdX in the following instructions with the device name for
the SD card as it appears on your computer.

1. Zero the beginning of the SD card:
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M count=8
2. Start fdisk to partition the SD card:
   fdisk /dev/sdX
3. At the fdisk prompt, create the new partitions:
   a. Type o. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
   b. Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
   c. Type n, then p for primary, 1 for the first partition on the drive,
      enter twice to accept the default starting and ending sectors.
   d. Type t, then 1 to select first partition and then b to change the
      partition type into FAT32.
   e. Write the partition table and exit by typing w.
4. Create the filesystem:
   mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdX1

-- Boot files
